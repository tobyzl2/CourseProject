            "summary": "The singularity refers to an idea that once a machine having an artificial intelligence surpassing the human intelligence capacity is created, it will trigger explosive technological and intelligence growth. I propose to test the hypothesis that machine intelligence capacity can grow autonomously starting with an intelligence comparable to that of bacteria - microbial intelligence. The goal will be to demonstrate that rapid growth in intelligence capacity can be realized at all in artificial computing systems. I propose the following three properties that may allow an artificial intelligence to exhibit a steady growth in its intelligence capacity: (i) learning with the ability to modify itself when exposed to more data, (ii) acquiring new functionalities (skills), and (iii) expanding or replicating itself. The algorithms must demonstrate a rapid growth in skills of dataprocessing and analysis and gain qualitatively different functionalities, at least until the current computing technology supports their scalable development. The existing algorithms that already encompass some of these or similar properties, as well as missing abilities that must yet be implemented, will be reviewed in this work. Future computational tests could support or oppose the hypothesis that artificial intelligence can potentially grow to the level of superintelligence which overcomes the limitations in hardware by producing necessary processing resources or by changing the physical realization of computation from using chip circuits to using quantum computing principles."

Artificial Intelligence has the potential to affect all of our lives and a new era for modern humans. This paper is an attempt to explore the ideas associated with intelligence, and by doing so understand the implications, constraints, and potentially the capabilities of future Artificial Intelligence. As an exploration, we journey into different parts of intelligence that appear essential. We hope that people find this useful in determining where Artificial Intelligence may be headed. Also, during the exploration, we hope to create new thought-provoking questions. Intelligence is not a single weighable quantity but a subject that spans Biology, Physics, Philosophy, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology, and Computer Science. Historian Yuval Noah Harari pointed out that engineers and scientists in the future will have to broaden their understandings to include disciplines such as Psychology, Philosophy, and Ethics. Fiction writers have long portrayed engineers and scientists as deficient in these areas. Today, modern society, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, and legal requirements all act as forcing functions to push these broader subjects into the foreground. We start with an introduction to intelligence and move quickly onto more profound thoughts and ideas. We call this a Life, the Universe and Everything primer, after the famous science fiction book by Douglas Adams. Forty-two may very well be the right answer, but what are the questions?"

This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI development level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the human intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason for which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and the beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system model is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings like human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract mathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine mathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the Liufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial intelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the evaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human subjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of the absolute IQ and deviation IQ ranking for artificial intelligence IQ 2014."

Value of this kind of marketing has improved in time, thanks to the latest developments regarding to computer and communication technologies. Nowadays, especially social media based platforms have a great importance on enabling companies to design multimedia oriented, interactive content. But on the other hand, there is still something more to do for improved content marketing approaches. In this context, objective of this study is to focus on intelligent content marketing, which can be done by using artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is todays one of the most remarkable research fields and it can be used easily as multidisciplinary. So, this study has aimed to discuss about its potential on improving content marketing. In detail, the study has enabled readers to improve their awareness about the intersection point of content marketing and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the authors have introduced some example models of intelligent content marketing, which can be achieved by using current Web technologies and artificial intelligence techniques."

            "summary": "We define a notion of the intelligence level of an idealized mechanical knowing agent. This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent, then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter. This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can then design even more intelligent machines, and so on)."

An important characteristic of several methodologies that reason with changes in belief or belief updates, is a property that we term modularity. We call updates that satisfy this property modular updates. Whereas probabilistic measures of belief update - which satisfy the modularity property were first discovered in the nineteenth century, knowledge and discussion of these quantities remains obscure in artificial intelligence research. We define modular updates and discuss their inappropriate use in two influential expert systems."

            "summary": "The large distances involved in interstellar travel require a high degree of spacecraft autonomy, realized by artificial intelligence. The breadth of tasks artificial intelligence could perform on such spacecraft involves maintenance, data collection, designing and constructing an infrastructure using in-situ resources. Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial intelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where little detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This article explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by compiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system and mission architectures. Estimations for the required intelligence level for specific types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system and mission architectures, covering those proposed in the literature but also presenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design for interstellar probes with an AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational power, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would have a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given that the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general intelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth exploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing on neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from radiation in interstellar space and the role of artificial intelligence in self-replication."

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence."

However, this bright future has a dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, these workers are digging their own graves.   In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI) as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Robin Hoods, HIT-AI researchers should fight for a fairer Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals."

To compare the potential intelligence exhibited by different cognitive systems, I use the common approach used by artificial intelligence and artificial life: Instead of studying the substrate of systems, let us focus on their organization. This organization can be measured with information. Thus, I apply an informationist epistemology to describe cognitive systems, including brains and computers. This allows me to frame the usefulness and limitations of the brain-computer analogy in different contexts. I also use this perspective to discuss the evolution and ecology of intelligence."

I claim that these problems acquire their structure from three fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution."

It will be done only by artificial intelligence and internet of things."

In time, the field of Artificial Intelligence has been divided into many sub-fields because of increasing number of different solution approaches, methods, and techniques. Machine Learning has the most remarkable role with its functions to learn from samples from the environment. On the other hand, intelligent optimization done by inspiring from nature and swarms had its own unique scientific literature, with effective solutions provided for optimization problems from different fields. Because intelligent optimization can be applied in different fields effectively, this study aims to provide a general discussion on multidisciplinary effects of Artificial Intelligence by considering its optimization oriented solutions. The study briefly focuses on background of the intelligent optimization briefly and then gives application examples of intelligent optimization from a multidisciplinary perspective."

Even today, it is possible to see intense use of intelligence systems in all fields of the life. Although advantages of the Artificial Intelligence are widely observed, there is also a dark side employing efforts to design hacking oriented techniques against Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to such techniques, it is possible to trick intelligent systems causing directed results for unsuccessful outputs. That is critical for also cyber wars of the future as it is predicted that the wars will be done unmanned, autonomous intelligent systems. Moving from the explanations, objective of this study is to provide information regarding adversarial examples threatening the Artificial Intelligence and focus on details of some techniques, which are used for creating adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are known as training data, which can trick a Machine Learning technique to learn incorrectly about the target problem and cause an unsuccessful or maliciously directed intelligent system at the end. The study enables the readers to learn enough about details of recent techniques for creating adversarial examples."

The majority of current artificial intelligence research operates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without considering the importance of the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and unify principles that guide the basis of our development of general artificial intelligence. These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a tool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as the ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help steer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying, measuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level intelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both implementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable way to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary conditions in the search for general artificial intelligence. We believe that such a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together definitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to collaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this century."

It contributes greatly to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years, AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India. The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called Brain Intelligence (BI) that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial robots."

Using the concept of 'multiple intelligences' rather than a single type of intelligence, we categorize and provide working definitions of various AGI depending on their cognitive skills or capacities. Future AI systems will be able not only to communicate with human users and each other, but also to efficiently exchange knowledge and wisdom with abilities of cooperation, collaboration and even co-creating something new and valuable and have meta-learning capacities. Multi-agent systems such as these can be used to solve problems that would be difficult to solve by any individual intelligent agent.

We argue that Hibbard's idea should actually be considered as two separate ideas: first, that the intelligence of such agents can be measured based on the growth rates of the runtimes of the competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary) method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard's intelligence measure is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an intelligence measure should look like. We discuss how intelligence measurement of sequence predictors can indirectly serve as intelligence measurement for agents with Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs)."

The Service IQ and Value IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of serving human."

This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence methods that provide flexibility and learning capability. The likelihood of developing cyber defense capabilities through increased intelligence of defense systems is quite high. Given the problems associated with cyber defense in real life, it is clear that many cyber defense problems can be successfully solved only when artificial intelligence methods are used.

In this paper, we build a model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then, the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by multiplicative growth."

Spatial hardware accelerator exhibits complex design space. Prior approaches based on manual implementation lead to low programming productivity, rendering thorough design space exploration impossible. In this paper, we propose TensorLib, a framework for generating spatial hardware accelerator for tensor algebra applications. TensorLib is motivated by the observation that, different dataflows share common hardware modules, which can be reused across different designs. To build such a framework, TensorLib first uses Space-Time Transformation to explore different dataflows, which can compactly represent the hardware dataflow using a simple transformation matrix. Next, we identify the common structures of different dataflows and build parameterized hardware module templates with Chisel. Our generation framework can select the needed hardware modules for each dataflow, connect the modules using a specified interconnection pattern, and automatically generate the complete hardware accelerator design. TensorLib remarkably improves the productivity for the development and optimization of spatial hardware architecture, providing a rich design space with trade-offs in performance, area, and power. Experiments show that TensorLib can automatically generate hardware designs with different dataflows and achieve 21\\% performance improvement on FPGA compared to the state-of-the-arts."

Consequently, verification time dominates implementation time. The gold standard in hardware Design Verification (DV) is concentrated at two extremes: random dynamic verification and formal verification. Both struggle to root out the subtle flaws in complex hardware that often manifest as security vulnerabilities. The root problem with random verification is its undirected nature, making it inefficient, while formal verification is constrained by the state-space explosion problem, making it infeasible against complex designs. What is needed is a solution that is directed, yet under-constrained.   Instead of making incremental improvements to existing DV approaches, we leverage the observation that existing software fuzzers already provide such a solution, and adapt them for hardware DV. Specifically, we translate RTL hardware to a software model and fuzz that model. The central challenge we address is how best to mitigate the differences between the hardware execution model and software execution model. This includes: 1) how to represent test cases, 2) what is the hardware equivalent of a crash, 3) what is an appropriate coverage metric, and 4) how to create a general-purpose fuzzing harness for hardware.   To evaluate our approach, we fuzz four IP blocks from Google's OpenTitan SoC. Our experiments reveal a two orders-of-magnitude reduction in run time to achieve Finite State Machine (FSM) coverage over traditional dynamic verification schemes. Moreover, with our design-agnostic harness, we achieve over 88% HDL line coverage in three out of four of our designs -- even without any initial seeds."

            "summary": "Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design."

The design space of such hardware is very large due to the wide range of processing architectures, deep neural network configurations, and dataflow options.

We present TRIM, an infrastructure to help hardware architects explore the design space of deep neural network accelerators for both inference and training in the early design stages. The model evaluates at the whole network level, considering both inter-layer and intra-layer activities. Given applications, essential hardware specifications, and a design goal, TRIM can quickly explore different hardware design options, select the optimal dataflow and guide new hardware architecture design. We validated TRIM with FPGA-based implementation of deep neural network accelerators and ASIC-based architectures.

For each design architecture, we also propose an algorithm that tunes the integer weights to reduce the hardware complexity avoiding a loss in the hardware accuracy. Furthermore, the multiplications of constant weights by input variables are implemented under the shift-adds architecture using the fewest number of addition/subtraction operations found by prominent previously proposed algorithms. Finally, we introduce a computer-aided design (CAD) tool, called SIMURG, that can describe an ANN design in hardware automatically based on the ANN structure and the solutions of proposed design techniques and algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the tuning techniques can significantly reduce the ANN hardware complexity under a design architecture and the multiplierless design of ANN can lead to a significant reduction in area and energy consumption, increasing the latency slightly."

In doing so, however, quite a variety of superior concepts is excluded a priori. Consequently, co-design of both hardware and software is crucial where highest performance is the goal. For special purpose application, this co-design is common practice. For general purpose application, however, a precondition for usability of a computer system is an operating system which is both comprehensive and dynamic. As no such operating system has ever been designed, a sketch for a comprehensive dynamic operating system is presented, based on a straightforward hardware architecture to demonstrate how design decisions regarding software and hardware do coexist and harmonise."

Most existing artificial intelligence (AI) chips have evolved to rely on new chip technologies rather than on radically new hardware architectures, to maintain their generality. This study proposes a novel, special-purpose, and high-efficiency hardware architecture for convolutional neural networks. The proposed architecture maximizes the utilization of multipliers by designing the computational circuit with the same structure as that of the computational flow of the model, rather than mapping computations to fixed hardware. In addition, a specially designed filter circuit simultaneously provides all the data of the receptive field, using only one memory read operation during each clock cycle; this allows the computation circuit to operate seamlessly without idle cycles. Our reference system based on the proposed architecture uses 97% of the peak-multiplication capability in actual computations required by the computation model throughout the computation period. In addition, overhead components are minimized so that the proportion of the resources constituting the non-multiplier components is smaller than that constituting the multiplier components, which are indispensable for the computational model. The efficiency of the proposed architecture is close to an ideally efficient system that cannot be improved further in terms of the performance-to-resource ratio. An implementation based on the proposed hardware architecture has been applied in commercial AI products."

This paper instead casts the problem as hardware/software co-design, with the goal of automatically identifying desirable points in the joint design space. The key to our solution is a new constrained Bayesian optimization framework that avoids invalid solutions by exploiting the highly constrained features of this design space, which are semi-continuous/semi-discrete.

In order to address these implementation challenges, a broad spectrum of new customized and heterogeneous hardware architectures have emerged, often accompanied with co-designed algorithms to extract maximum benefit out of the hardware. Furthermore, numerous optimization techniques are being explored for neural networks to reduce compute and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. This results in an abundance of algorithmic and architectural choices, some of which fit specific use cases better than others.   For system level designers, there is currently no good way to compare the variety of hardware, algorithm and optimization options. While there are many benchmarking efforts in this field, they cover only subsections of the embedded design space. None of the existing benchmarks support essential algorithmic optimizations such as quantization, an important technique to stay on chip, or specialized heterogeneous hardware architectures.

These expressions provide important insights into the practical impact of hardware impairments and also how to efficiently deploy cell-free systems. Furthermore, a novel hardware-quality scaling law is presented. It proves that the impact of hardware impairments at the APs vanish as the number of APs grows.

SNN-based machine-learning programs are typically executed on tile- based neuromorphic hardware platforms, where each tile consists of a computation unit called crossbar, which maps neurons and synapses of the program. However, synthesizing such programs on an off-the-shelf neuromorphic hardware is challenging. This is because of the inherent resource and latency limitations of the hardware, which impact both model performance, e.g., accuracy, and hardware performance, e.g., throughput. We propose DFSynthesizer, an end-to-end framework for synthesizing SNN-based machine learning programs to neuromorphic hardware. The proposed framework works in four steps. First, it analyzes a machine-learning program and generates SNN workload using representative data. Second, it partitions the SNN workload and generates clusters that fit on crossbars of the target neuromorphic hardware. Third, it exploits the rich semantics of Synchronous Dataflow Graph (SDFG) to represent a clustered SNN program, allowing for performance analysis in terms of key hardware constraints such as number of crossbars, dimension of each crossbar, buffer space on tiles, and tile communication bandwidth. Finally, it uses a novel scheduling algorithm to execute clusters on crossbars of the hardware, guaranteeing hardware performance. We evaluate DFSynthesizer with 10 commonly used machine-learning programs. Our results demonstrate that DFSynthesizer provides much tighter performance guarantee compared to current mapping approaches."

Such a practice greatly opens up the design freedom and pushes forward the Pareto frontier between hardware efficiency and test accuracy for better design tradeoffs. The framework iteratively performs a two-level (fast and slow) exploration. Without lengthy training, the fast exploration can effectively fine-tune hyperparameters and prune inferior architectures in terms of hardware specifications, which significantly accelerates the NAS process. Then, the slow exploration trains candidates on a validation set and updates a controller using the reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy together with the hardware efficiency. Experiments on ImageNet show that our co-exploration NAS can find the neural architectures and associated hardware design with the same accuracy, 35.24% higher throughput, 54.05% higher energy efficiency and 136x reduced search time, compared with the state-of-the-art hardware-aware NAS."

Specifically, for each floating point addition performed, we \"recycle\" that operation's error: the difference between the finite-precision result produced by the hardware and the result that would have been produced by an infinite-precision FPU. We make this error architecturally visible such that it can be used, if desired, by software. Experimental results on physical hardware show that software that exploits architecturally recycled error bits can achieve accuracy comparable to a 2B-bit FPU with performance and energy that are comparable to a B-bit FPU."

In this paper, we present NTP (Neural Net Topology Profiler), a sophisticated benchmarking framework, to effectively identify memory and compute signature of an end-to-end topology on multiple hardware architectures, without the need for an actual implementation. NTP is tightly integrated with hardware specific benchmarking tools to enable exhaustive data collection and analysis. Using NTP, a deep learning researcher can quickly establish baselines needed to understand performance of an end-to-end neural network topology and make high level architectural decisions. Further, integration of NTP with frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Intel OpenVINO etc. allows for performance comparison along several vectors like a) Comparison of different frameworks on a given hardware b) Comparison of different hardware using a given framework c) Comparison across different heterogeneous hardware configurations for given framework etc. These capabilities empower a researcher to effortlessly make architectural decisions needed for achieving optimized performance on any hardware platform. The paper documents the architectural approach of NTP and demonstrates the capabilities of the tool by benchmarking Mozilla DeepSpeech, a popular Speech Recognition topology."

We evaluate the co-design using different flit sizes for synthetic study, illustrating its effectiveness under various hardware resource constraints, in addition to a wide range of DNN models selected from real-world workloads.

NISQ hardware is characterized by a small number of qubits (50 to a few hundred) and noisy operations. Moreover, current realisations of superconducting quantum chips do not have the ideal all-to-all connectivity between qubits but rather at most a nearest-neighbour connectivity. All these hardware restrictions add supplementary low-level requirements. They need to be addressed before submitting the quantum circuit to an actual chip. Satisfying these requirements is a tedious task for the programmer. Instead, the task of adapting the quantum circuit to a given hardware is left to the compiler. In this paper, we propose a Hardware-Aware mapping transition algorithm (HA) that takes the calibration data into account with the aim to improve the overall fidelity of the circuit. Evaluation results on IBM quantum hardware show that our HA approach can outperform the state of the art both in terms of the number of additional gates and circuit fidelity."

However, quantum hardware suffers from much higher error rates than in classical hardware. As a result, extensive quantum error correction is required to execute a useful quantum algorithm. The decoder is a key component of the error correction scheme whose role is to identify errors faster than they accumulate in the quantum computer and that must be implemented with minimum hardware resources in order to scale to the regime of practical applications. In this work, we consider surface code error correction, which is the most popular family of error correcting codes for quantum computing, and we design a decoder micro-architecture for the Union-Find decoding algorithm. We propose a three-stage fully pipelined hardware implementation of the decoder that significantly speeds up the decoder. Then, we optimize the amount of decoding hardware required to perform error correction simultaneously over all the logical qubits of the quantum computer. By sharing resources between logical qubits, we obtain a 67% reduction of the number of hardware units and the memory capacity is reduced by 70%. Moreover, we reduce the bandwidth required for the decoding process by a factor at least 30x using low-overhead compression algorithms. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that our optimized micro-architecture can be executed fast enough to correct errors in a quantum computer."

They must also support agile exploration of hardware-software co-design, i.e. changes in the programming model, compiler, ISA, and specialized hardware.   To meet these challenges, we introduce MosaicSim, a lightweight, modular simulator for heterogeneous systems, offering accuracy and agility designed specifically for hardware-software co-design explorations. By integrating the LLVM toolchain, MosaicSim enables efficient modeling of instruction dependencies and flexible additions across the stack. Its modularity also allows the composition and integration of different hardware components. We first demonstrate that MosaicSim captures architectural bottlenecks in applications, and accurately models both scaling trends in a multicore setting and accelerator behavior.

To minimize such deployment cost, we propose an alternative solution, multi-hardware models, where a single architecture is developed for multiple hardware. With thoughtful search space design and incorporating the proposed multi-hardware metrics in neural architecture search, we discover multi-hardware models that give state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple hardware in both average and worse case scenarios.

However, the deployment of these systems requires huge computing capabilities, thus making them unsuitable for embedded systems. To deal with this limitation, many researchers are investigating brain-inspired computing, which would be a perfect alternative to the conventional Von Neumann architecture based computers (CPU/GPU) that meet the requirements for computing performance, but not for energy-efficiency. Therefore, neuromorphic hardware circuits that are adaptable for both parallel and distributed computations need to be designed. In this paper, we focus on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a comprehensive study of information coding methods and hardware exploration. In this context, we propose a framework for neuromorphic hardware design space exploration, which allows to define a suitable architecture based on application-specific constraints and starting from a wide variety of possible architectural choices. For this framework, we have developed a behavioral level simulator for neuromorphic hardware architectural exploration named NAXT. Moreover, we propose modified versions of the standard Rate Coding technique to make trade-offs with the Time Coding paradigm, which is characterized by the low number of spikes propagating in the network. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of spikes while keeping the same neuron's model, which results in an SNN with fewer events to process. By doing so, we seek to reduce the amount of power consumed by the hardware. Furthermore, we present three neuromorphic hardware architectures in order to quantitatively study the implementation of SNNs.

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy, and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design."

Although CNN hardware accelerators are already included as part of many SoC architectures, the task of achieving high accuracy on resource-restricted devices is still considered challenging, mainly due to the vast number of design parameters that need to be balanced to achieve an efficient solution. Quantization techniques, when applied to the network parameters, lead to a reduction of power and area and may also change the ratio between communication and computation. As a result, some algorithmic solutions may suffer from lack of memory bandwidth or computational resources and fail to achieve the expected performance due to hardware constraints. Thus, the system designer and the micro-architect need to understand at early development stages the impact of their high-level decisions (e.g., the architecture of the CNN and the amount of bits used to represent its parameters) on the final product (e.g., the expected power saving, area, and accuracy). Unfortunately, existing tools fall short of supporting such decisions.   This paper introduces a hardware-aware complexity metric that aims to assist the system designer of the neural network architectures, through the entire project lifetime (especially at its early stages) by predicting the impact of architectural and micro-architectural decisions on the final product. We demonstrate how the proposed metric can help evaluate different design alternatives of neural network models on resource-restricted devices such as real-time embedded systems, and to avoid making design mistakes at early stages."

However, due to ineffectual caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth, and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis. Second, to reduce the software overhead of good replacement policies, we propose recently- accessed-page-id (RAPid) buffer, a hardware buffer to track the addresses of recently-accessed MigrantStore pages."

            "summary": "The design of tiny trust anchors has received significant attention over the past decade, to secure low-end MCU-s that cannot afford expensive security mechanisms. In particular, hardware/software (hybrid) co-designs offer low hardware cost, while retaining similar security guarantees as (more expensive) hardware-based techniques. Hybrid trust anchors support security services, such as remote attestation, proofs of software update/erasure/reset, proofs of remote software execution, in resource-constrained MCU-s, e.g., MSP430 and AVR AtMega32. Despite these advances, detection of control-flow attacks in low-end MCU-s remains a challenge, since hardware requirements of the cheapest related architectures are often more expensive than the MCU-s themselves. In this work, we tackle this challenge by designing Tiny-CFA - a control-flow attestation (CFA) technique with a single hardware requirement - the ability to generate proofs of remote software execution (PoX). In turn, PoX can be implemented very efficiently and securely in low-end MCU-s. Consequently, our design achieves the lowest hardware overhead of any CFA architecture (i.e., two orders of magnitude cheaper), while relying on a formally verified PoX architecture as its sole hardware requirement. With respect to runtime overhead, Tiny-CFA also achieves better performance than prior CFA techniques based on code instrumentation. We implement and evaluate Tiny-CFA, analyze its security, and demonstrate its practicality using real-world publicly available applications."

            "summary": "Applying deep neural networks (DNNs) in mobile and safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, demands a reliable and efficient execution on hardware. Optimized dedicated hardware accelerators are being developed to achieve this. However, the design of efficient and reliable hardware has become increasingly difficult, due to the increased complexity of modern integrated circuit technology and its sensitivity against hardware faults, such as random bit-flips. It is thus desirable to exploit optimization potential for error resilience and efficiency also at the algorithmic side, e.g., by optimizing the architecture of the DNN. Since there are numerous design choices for the architecture of DNNs, with partially opposing effects on the preferred characteristics (such as small error rates at low latency), multi-objective optimization strategies are necessary. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary optimization technique for the automated design of hardware-optimized DNN architectures. For this purpose, we derive a set of easily computable objective functions, which enable the fast evaluation of DNN architectures with respect to their hardware efficiency and error resilience solely based on the network topology. We observe a strong correlation between predicted error resilience and actual measurements obtained from fault injection simulations. Furthermore, we analyze two different quantization schemes for efficient DNN computation and find significant differences regarding their effect on error resilience."

Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art hardware-aware NAS methods under the same latency constraint on three types of hardware. Moreover, the discovered architectures achieve much lower latency and higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art efficient models.

Though FPGAs are an ideal target for energy efficient custom accelerators, the difficulty of hardware design and the lack of vendor agnostic, standardized hardware compilation infrastructure has hindered their adoption.   This paper introduces HIR, an MLIR-based intermediate representation (IR) to describe hardware accelerator designs. HIR combines high level language features, such as loops and multi-dimensional tensors, with programmer defined explicit scheduling, to provide a high-level IR suitable for DSL compiler pipelines without compromising control over the micro-architecture of the accelerator. HIR's explicit schedules allow it to express fine-grained, synchronization-free parallelism and optimizations such as retiming and pipelining. Built as a dialect in MLIR, it draws from best IR practices learnt from communities like those of LLVM. While offering rich optimization opportunities and a high level abstraction, HIR enables sharing of optimizations, utilities and passes with software compiler infrastructure.   Our implementation shows that the code generation time of the HIR code generator is on average 1112x lower than that of Xilinx Vivado HLS on a range of kernels without a compromise on the quality of the generated hardware. We believe that these are significant steps forward in the design of IRs for hardware synthesis and in equipping domain-specific languages with a productive and performing compilation path to custom hardware acceleration."

These networks can tremendously improve the quality of life by enabling various use cases that require high data-rate, low latency, and continuous connectivity for applications pertaining to eHealth, automatic vehicles, smart cities, smart grid, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

However, there is a gap in the literature which particularly needs to follow recent computing paradigms as alternative mechanisms for the enhancement of security. To cover this, a detailed description of the security for the 5G networks is presented in this article along with the discussions on the evolution of osmotic and catalytic computing-based security modules. The taxonomy on the basis of security requirements is presented, which also includes the comparison of the existing state-of-the-art solutions. This article also provides a security model, \"CATMOSIS\", which idealizes the incorporation of security features on the basis of catalytic and osmotic computing in the 5G networks.

            "summary": "It is of folkloric belief that the security of classical cryptographic protocols is automatically broken if the Adversary is allowed to perform superposition queries and the honest players forced to perform actions coherently on quantum states. Another widely held intuition is that enforcing measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from these attacks.   However, the reality is much more complex. Security models dealing with superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. Conversely, security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of superposition attacks. Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge, an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing.   In this work, we propose the first computational security model considering superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad protocol and give an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: Adding extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks. We use this newly imparted knowledge to construct the first concrete protocol for Secure Two-Party Computation that is resistant to superposition attacks. Our results show that there is no straightforward answer to provide for either the vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted countermeasures."

To demonstrate the applicability of the CloudSafe, we conducted security assessment in Amazon AWS, where our experimental results showed that we can effectively gather security information of the cloud and carry out security assessment to produce security reports.

However, there is still no consolidated mechanism to evaluate the trade-offs between availability and security when using MTD on cloud computing. The evaluation through measurements is complex as one needs to deal with unexpected events as failures and attacks. To overcome this challenge, we intend to propose a set of models to evaluate the availability and security of MTD in cloud computing environments. The expected results include the quantification of availability and security levels under different conditions (e.g., different software aging rates, varying workloads, different attack intensities)."

The international community is fully aware of the urgent need to secure the cyberspace as you see the multiplication of security standards and national schemes interpreting them beyond borders: ISO 15408, ISO 17799, and ISO 27001. Even though some countries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their security books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of security as long as they share their networks with entities of less security. The standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the development of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders have to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the partnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the continuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and certification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the partnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic society. In order to clean our society from cyber crimes and cyber terrorism we need to impose strict security policies and enforce them in a cooperative manner.

To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks.

Fortunately, as a novel computing paradigm, edge computing (MEC) can provide abundant computing resources to execute all or parts of the tasks of MDs and thereby can greatly reduce the energy of MD and improve the QoS of applications. However, offloading workflow tasks to the MEC servers are liable to external security threats (e.g., snooping, alteration). In this paper, we propose a security and energy efficient computation offloading (SEECO) strategy for service workflows in MEC environment, the goal of which is to optimize the energy consumption under the risk probability and deadline constraints. First, we build a security overhead model to measure the execution time of security services. Then, we formulate the computation offloading problem by incorporating the security, energy consumption and execution time of workflow application. Finally, based on the genetic algorithm (GA), the corresponding coding strategies of SEECO are devised by considering tasks execution order and location and security services selection. Extensive experiments with the variety of workflow parameters demonstrate that SEECO strategy can achieve the security and energy efficiency for the mobile applications."

It is unclear whether the idea of cut-and-choose can be adapted to secure computation with information-theoretic security. In this work we explore the possibility of using cut-and-choose in information theoretic setting for secure three-party computation (3PC). Previous work on 3PC has mainly focus on the semi-honest case, and is motivated by the observation that real-word deployments of multi-party computation (MPC) seem to involve few parties. We propose a new protocol for information-theoretically secure 3PC tolerating one malicious party with cheating probability $2^{-s}$ using $s$ runs of circuit computation in the cut-and-choose paradigm. The computational cost of our protocol is essentially only a small constant worse than that of state-of-the-art 3PC protocols against a semi-honest corruption, while its communication round is greatly reduced compared to other maliciously secure 3PC protocols in information-theoretic setting."

As an example, different secure auction mechanisms have been widely studied, which can protect bid privacy while satisfying various economic properties. However, as far as we know, none of them solve the secure computation problems for multiple data providers (e.g., secure cloud resource auctions) in the malicious security model. In this paper, we use the techniques of cut-and-choose and garbled circuits to propose a general secure computation framework for multiple data providers against malicious adversaries. Specifically, our framework checks input consistency with the cut-and-choose paradigm, conducts maliciously secure computations by running two independent garbled circuits, and verifies the correctness of output by comparing two versions of outputs. Theoretical analysis shows that our framework is secure against a malicious computation party, or a subset of malicious data providers. Taking secure cloud resource auctions as an example, we implement our framework. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the performance of the proposed framework is acceptable in practice."

In this work, we explore the possibility of constructing a secure cloud storage for dynamic data by leveraging the algorithms involved in secure network coding. We show that some of the secure network coding schemes can be used to construct efficient secure cloud storage protocols for dynamic data, and we construct such a protocol (DSCS I) based on a secure network coding protocol. To the best of our knowledge, DSCS I is the first secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data constructed using secure network coding techniques which is secure in the standard model. Although generic dynamic data support arbitrary insertions, deletions and modifications, append-only data find numerous applications in the real world. We construct another secure cloud storage protocol (DSCS II) specific to append-only data -- that overcomes some limitations of DSCS I.

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies."

This meta-methodological question is related to recent explorations on the science of computer security, which have been hindered by computer security's unique properties.

Interdisciplinary foundations provide a solid grounding for a set of essential concepts, including a decision tree for characterizing adversarial interaction. Several types of invalidation and general ways of addressing them are described for technical methods. An interdisciplinary argument from theory explains the role that meta-methodological validation plays in the adversarial science of computer security."

In such schemes, both the encrypted biometric database and the identification process are outsourced to the cloud. The ultimate goal is to protect the security and privacy of the biometric database and the query templates. Security analysis shows that previous schemes suffer from the enrolment attack and unnecessarily expose more information than needed. In this paper, we propose a new secure outsourcing scheme aims at enhancing the security from these two aspects. First, besides all the attacks discussed in previous schemes, our proposed scheme is also secure against the enrolment attack. Second, we model the identification process as a fixed radius similarity query problem instead of the kNN search problem. Such a modelling is able to reduce the exposed information thus enhancing the privacy of the biometric database. Our comprehensive security and complexity analysis show that our scheme is able to enhance the security and privacy of the biometric database and query templates while maintaining the same computational savings from outsourcing."

            "summary": "The access control problem in a hierarchy can be solved by using a hierarchical key assignment scheme, where each class is assigned an encryption key and some private information. A formal security analysis for hierarchical key assignment schemes has been traditionally considered in two different settings, i.e., the unconditionally secure and the computationally secure setting, and with respect to two different notions: security against key recovery (KR-security) and security with respect to key indistinguishability (KI-security), with the latter notion being cryptographically stronger. Recently, Freire, Paterson and Poettering proposed strong key indistinguishability (SKI-security) as a new security notion in the computationally secure setting, arguing that SKI-security is strictly stronger than KI-security in such a setting. In this paper we consider the unconditionally secure setting for hierarchical key assignment schemes. In such a setting the security of the schemes is not based on specific unproven computational assumptions, i.e., it relies on the theoretical impossibility of breaking them, despite the computational power of an adversary coalition. We prove that, in this setting, SKI-security is not stronger than KI-security, i.e., the two notions are fully equivalent from an information-theoretic point of view."

Such privacy concerns have been instrumental in the creation of several regulations and acts to restrict the availability and use of privacy-sensitive data. The secure computation problem, initially and formally introduced as secure two-party computation by Andrew Yao in 1986, has been the focus of intense research in academia because of its fundamental role in building many of the existing privacy-preserving approaches. Most of the existing secure computation solutions rely on garbled-circuits and homomorphic encryption techniques to tackle secure computation issues, including efficiency and security guarantees. However, it is still challenging to adopt these secure computation approaches in emerging compute-intensive and data-intensive applications such as emerging machine learning solutions. Recently proposed functional encryption scheme has shown its promise as an underlying secure computation foundation in recent privacy-preserving machine learning approaches proposed. This paper revisits the secure computation problem using emerging and promising functional encryption techniques and presents a comprehensive study. We first briefly summarize existing conventional secure computation approaches built on garbled-circuits, oblivious transfer, and homomorphic encryption techniques. Then, we elaborate on the unique characteristics and challenges of emerging functional encryption based secure computation approaches and outline several research directions."

We have realized the urgent need of using simple and efficient secure protocol in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) to be practical in the fast mobility of the network nodes, and taking advantage of the existence of base stations gateways along the road to inherit the protocol to different VANETs, this will reduce the initialization of communication overhead time and the security keys initialization each time a node passes to new base station zone. In this research, we applied security protocol used in sensor networks to achieve security in VANET, the simulation analysis shows that secure practical communication is achieved which can be inherited to other sub VANETs. The contribution of this article is enhancing proposed protocols with as less cryptography computation overhead as possible to make it applicable in the high mobility nature of VANET using security primitives; which guarantees security while allowing fast authenticating during vehicle passing one VANET to the next one depending on its direction in the transportation networks."

On the other hand, some studies have revealed that security experts believe programmers have a major role to play in ensuring the end-users' security. However, there has been no investigation on what programmers perceive about their responsibility for the end-users' security of applications they develop. In this work, by conducting a qualitative experimental study with 40 software developers, we attempted to understand the programmer's perception on who is responsible for ensuring end-users' security of the applications they develop. Results revealed majority of programmers perceive that they are responsible for the end-users' security of applications they develop. Furthermore, results showed that even though programmers aware of things they need to do to ensure end-users' security, they do not often follow them. We believe these results would change the current view on the role that different stakeholders of the software development process (i.e. researchers, security experts, programmers and Application Programming Interface (API) developers) have to play in order to ensure the security of software applications."

Software security is a research field in this area which looks at how security can be weaved into software at each phase of software development lifecycle (SDLC). The use of attack patterns is one of the approaches that have been proposed for integrating security during the design phase of SDLC. While this approach help developers in identify security flaws in their software designs, the need to apply the proper security capability that will mitigate the threat identified is very important. To assist in this area, the uses of security patterns have been proposed to help developers to identify solutions to recurring security problems. However due to different types of security patterns and their taxonomy, software developers are faced with the challenge of finding and selecting appropriate security patterns that addresses the security risks in their design. In this paper, we propose a tool based on Neural Network for proposing solutions in form of security patterns to threats in attack patterns matching attacking patterns. From the result of performance of the neural network, we found out that the neural network was able to match attack patterns to security patterns that can mitigate the threat in the attack pattern. With this information developers are better informed in making decision on the solution for securing their application."

The rise in cyber-crime, digital currency, e-governance, and more, is well met by a corresponding recent jump in investment in new technology for securing computers around the globe. Recently, business and government sectors have begun to focus efforts on comprehensive cyber security solutions. With this growth has emerged the need for greater methods of collabo-ration and measurement of security. Despite all these efforts, this need has not been met, and there is still too little cross-disciplinary collaboration in the realm of computer security. This paper reviews the new trends in cyber security research, their contributions, and some identifiable limitations. We argue that these limitations are due largely to the absence of co-operation required to address a problem that is clearly multifaceted. We then identify a need for further standardization of terminology in computer security and propose guidelines for the global Internet multistakeholder community to consider when crafting such standards. We also assess the viability of some specific terms, including whether cyber should be used as a separate word when it is a descriptor (e.g. cyber security or cybersecurity), and conclude with recommendations for writing future papers on cyber security or the broader new field of all things relating to cyberspace, which has recently been dubbed Cybermatics, a term we also examine and propose alternatives to, like Cyber or Cybernomics. By furthering the effort of standardizing cyber security terminology, this paper lays groundwork for cross-disciplinary collaboration, agreement between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, and the drafting of universal Internet governance laws."

Though integration of these critical intelligent technologies pose serious embedded security challenges for technology manufacturers which are required to be systematically approached, in-line with international security regulations. This paper establish security foundation for such intelligent technologies by deriving embedded security requirements to realise the core security functions laid out by international security authorities, and proposing microarchitectural characteristics to establish cyber resilience in embedded systems. To bridge the research gap between embedded and operational security domains, a detailed review of existing embedded security methods, microarchitectures and design practises is presented. The existing embedded security methods have been found ad-hoc, passive and strongly rely on building and maintaining trust. To the best of our knowledge to date, no existing embedded security microarchitecture or defence mechanism provides continuity of data stream or security once trust has broken. This functionality is critical for embedded technologies deployed in critical infrastructure to enhance and maintain security, and to gain evidence of the security breach to effectively evaluate, improve and deploy active response and mitigation strategies. To this end, the paper proposes three microarchitectural characteristics that shall be designed and integrated into embedded architectures to establish, maintain and improve cyber resilience in embedded systems for next-generation critical infrastructure."

While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by persisting the security knowledge gained from different cybersecurity context. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide-range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Although LDA has been widely adopted in topic generation, its generated topics cannot cover the cybersecurity concepts completely and considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories instead of LDA-generated topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings. (1) The impact reflected from cyber-security texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes. (2) For most categories, security blogs share the largest popularity and largest absolute/relative impact over time. (3) Websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much, where one third of the articles do not specify the date and the rest have a time lag in posting emerging security issues."

Hence, in this paper we evaluate the design of a serious game, to investigate the features and functionalities that users would find desirable in a game that aims to educate them to provide strong and memorable answers to security questions. Our findings reveal that: (1) even for security education games, rewards seem to motivate users to have a better learning experience; (2) functionalities which contain a social element (e.g. getting help from other players) do not seem appropriate for serious games related to security questions, because users fear that their acquaintances could gain access to their security questions; (3) even users who do not usually play games would seem to prefer to play security education games on a mobile device."

However, secure multiparty computation based only on classical cryptography is severely limited by the security and efficiency of the oblivious transfer implementation. We present a method to efficiently and securely generate and distribute oblivious keys by exchanging qubits and by performing commitments using classical hash functions. With the presented hybrid approach, quantum and classical, we obtain a practical and high-speed oblivious transfer protocol, secure even against quantum computer attacks. The oblivious distributed keys allow implementing a fast and secure oblivious transfer protocol, which can pave the way for the widespread of applications based on secure multiparty computation."

On this basis, a new security metric of cyber networks, which is known as the limit security, is defined as the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks. Next, the influence of different factors on the limit security is illuminated through theoretical analysis and computer simulation.

            "summary": "Delegating difficult computations to remote large computation facilities, with appropriate security guarantees, is a possible solution for the ever-growing needs of personal computing power. For delegated computation protocols to be usable in a larger context---or simply to securely run two protocols in parallel---the security definitions need to be composable. Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness---the computation is hidden from the server---and those that are also verifiable---the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct \"trace-distance-type\" criteria---which are, individually, non-composable security definitions.   Additionally, we study the security of some known delegated quantum computation protocols, including Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi's Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol. Even though these protocols were originally proposed with insufficient security criteria, they turn out to still be secure given the stronger composable definitions."

Since a lot of information is stored in databases (and not as HTML documents), it is important to provide a similar search paradigm for databases, where users can query a database without knowing the database schema and database query languages such as SQL. In this paper, we propose such a database search system, which accepts a free-form query as a collection of keywords, translates it into queries on the database using the database metadata, and presents query results in a well-structured and browsable form. Th eysytem maps keywords onto the database schema and uses inter-relationships (i.e., data semantics) among the referred tables to generate meaningful query results. We also describe our prototype for database search, called Mragyati. Th eapproach proposed here is scalable, as it does not build an in-memory graph of the entire database for searching for relationships among the objects selected by the user's query."

Yet today, when we think of a database we invariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management systems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box or cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How did the computerized database evolve?   This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the database, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage methods. Early database models are explored including the network and hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams, including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to support the text.   This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS development. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into the relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented development methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS."

Data centers, particularly databases, use up to 23% of this energy. Therefore, building an energy-efficient (green) database engine could reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.   Goal: To understand the factors driving databases' energy consumption and execution time throughout their evolution.   Method: We conducted an empirical case study of energy consumption by two MySQL database engines, InnoDB and MyISAM, across 40 releases. We examined the relationships of four software metrics to energy consumption and execution time to determine which metrics reflect the greenness and performance of a database.   Results: Our analysis shows that database engines' energy consumption and execution time increase as databases evolve. Moreover, the Lines of Code metric is correlated moderately to strongly with energy consumption and execution time in 88% of cases.   Conclusions: Our findings provide insights to both practitioners and researchers. Database administrators may use them to select a fast, green release of the MySQL database engine. MySQL database-engine developers may use the software metric to assess products' greenness and performance. Researchers may use our findings to further develop new hypotheses or build models to predict greenness and performance of databases."

Application scenarios of probabilistic databases however often involve the conditioning of a database using additional information in the form of new evidence. The conditioning problem is thus to transform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic database which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further refinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to the problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.   It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has led researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence computation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can be solved using such techniques.   In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems. We study several problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most successful search techniques from constraint satisfaction, such as the Davis-Putnam algorithm. We complement this with a thorough experimental evaluation of the algorithms proposed. Our experiments show that our exact algorithms scale well to realistic database sizes and can in some scenarios compete with the most efficient previous approximation algorithms."

In SPIR, a user retrieves a message out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-colluding and replicated databases in such a way that no single database knows the retrieved message index (user privacy), and the user gets to know nothing further than the retrieved message (database privacy). SPIR has a capacity smaller than the PIR capacity which requires only user privacy, is infeasible in the case of a single database, and requires shared common randomness among the databases. We introduce a new variant of SPIR where the user is provided with a random subset of the shared database common randomness, which is unknown to the databases. We determine the exact capacity region of the triple $(d, \\rho_S, \\rho_U)$, where $d$ is the download cost, $\\rho_S$ is the amount of shared database (server) common randomness, and $\\rho_U$ is the amount of available user-side common randomness. We show that with a suitable amount of $\\rho_U$, this new SPIR achieves the capacity of conventional PIR. As a corollary, single-database SPIR becomes feasible. Further, the presence of user-side $\\rho_U$ reduces the amount of required server-side $\\rho_S$."

A testing set of structures and their structure property functions provides an empirical measure of potential transferability. Here, we propose an objective function for fitting databases based on testing set errors. The objective function allows the optimization of the weights in a fitting database, the assessment of the inclusion or removal of structures in the fitting database, or the comparison of two different fitting databases. To showcase this technique, we consider an example Lennard-Jones potential for Ti, where modeling multiple complicated crystal structures is difficult for a radial pair potential.

Most of existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static databases.

To deal with such a situation, it is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in a database system to support continual keyword queries.   In this paper, we propose an efficient method for answering continual top-$k$ keyword queries over relational databases. The proposed method is built on an existing scheme of keyword search on relational data streams, but incorporates the ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two improvements to support efficient top-$k$ keyword search in relational databases. Compared to the existing methods, our method is more efficient both in computing the top-$k$ results in a static database and in maintaining the top-$k$ results when the database continually being updated.

An event log is represented as a tuple of the form CaseID, TimeStamp, Activity and Actor. Process Mining is an emerging area of research that deals with the study and analysis of business processes based on event logs. Process Mining aims at analyzing event logs and discover business process models, enhance them or check for conformance with an a priori model. The large volume of event logs generated are stored in databases. Relational databases perform well for certain class of applications. However, there are certain class of applications for which relational databases are not able to scale. A number of NoSQL databases have emerged to encounter the challenges of scalability. Discovering social network from event logs is one of the most challenging and important Process Mining task. Similar-Task and Sub-Contract algorithms are some of the most widely used Organizational Mining techniques. Our objective is to investigate which of the databases (Relational or Graph) perform better for Organizational Mining under Process Mining. An intersection of Process Mining and Graph Databases can be accomplished by modelling these Organizational Mining metrics with graph databases. We implement Similar-Task and Sub-Contract algorithms on relational and NoSQL (graph-oriented) databases using only query language constructs. We conduct empirical analysis on a large real world data set to compare the performance of row-oriented database and NoSQL graph-oriented database. We benchmark performance factors like query execution time, CPU usage and disk/memory space usage for NoSQL graph-oriented database against row-oriented database."

A stochastic database model is considered where the correlation among the database entries is governed by an arbitrary joint distribution. Concentration of measure theorems such as typicality and laws of large numbers are used to develop a database matching scheme and derive necessary conditions for successful matching. Furthermore, it is shown that these conditions are tight through a converse result which characterizes a set of distributions on the database entries for which reliable matching is not possible. The necessary and sufficient conditions for reliable matching are evaluated in the cases when the database entries are independent and identically distributed as well as under Markovian database models."

For the first question, we explain how database technology contributes to blockchain technology by unlocking different features such as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactional consistency, rich queries, real-time analytics, and low latency. We explain how the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem known for databases influenced the DCS (Decentralization, Consistency, Scalability) theorem for the blockchain systems. By using an analogous relaxation approach as it was used for the proof of the CAP theorem, we postulate a \"DCS-satisfiability conjecture.\" For the second question, we review different databases that are designed specifically for blockchain and provide most of the blockchain functionality like immutability, privacy, censorship resistance, along with database features."

In particular, focusing on databases with denial constraints, we first consider the natural approach of virtually transforming a database into a propositional knowledge base and then applying well-known measures. However, using this method, tuples and constraints are equally considered in charge of inconsistencies. Then, we introduce a version of inconsistency measures blaming database tuples only, i.e., treating integrity constraints as irrefutable statements.   We analyze the compliance of database inconsistency measures with standard rationality postulates and find interesting relationships between measures. Finally, we investigate the complexity of the inconsistency measurement problem as well as of the problems of deciding whether the inconsistency is lower than, greater than, or equal to a given threshold."

The database entries in DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases, particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of authors, institutions and funding bodies.   We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is also biased against low-cited papers.   Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per paper has been increasing over time."

Solving the problem of building indexes that truly optimize database access requires a substantial amount of database and domain knowledge, the lack of which often results in wasted space and memory for irrelevant indexes, possibly jeopardizing database performance for querying and certainly degrading performance for updating. We develop an architecture to solve the problem of automatically indexing a database by using reinforcement learning to optimize queries by indexing data throughout the lifetime of a database. In our experimental evaluation, our architecture shows superior performance compared to related work on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, maintaining near-optimal index configurations and efficiently scaling to large databases."

Developed database category DB, for databases (objects) and view-based mappings (morphisms) between them, is different from Set category: the morphisms (based on a set of complex query computations) are not functions, while the objects are database instances (sets of relations). The logic based schema mappings between databases, usually written in a highly expressive logical language (ex. LAV, GAV, GLAV mappings, or tuple generating dependency) may be functorially translated into this \"computation\" category DB. A new approach is adopted, based on the behavioral point of view for databases, and behavioral equivalences for databases and their mappings are established. By introduction of view-based observations for databases, which are computations without side-effects, we define a fundamental (Universal algebra) monad with a power-view endofunctor T. The resulting 2-category DB is symmetric, so that any mapping can be represented as an object (database instance) as well, where a higher-level mapping between mappings is a 2-cell morphism. Database category DB has the following properties: it is equal to its dual, complete and cocomplete. Special attention is devoted to practical examples: a query definition, a query rewriting in GAV Database-integration environment, and the fixpoint solution of a canonical data integration model."

This is embodied with a number of systems featuring advanced tuning capabilities being developed. However, it remains a challenge to select the best solution for database configuration tuning, considering the large body of algorithm choices. In addition, beyond the applications on database systems, we could find more potential algorithms designed for configuration tuning. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of configuration tuning techniques from a broader perspective, hoping to better benefit the database community. In particular, we summarize three key modules of database configuration tuning systems and conduct extensive ablation studies using various challenging cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that the hyper-parameter optimization algorithms can be borrowed to further enhance the database configuration tuning. Moreover, we identify the best algorithm choices for different modules. Beyond the comprehensive evaluations, we offer an efficient and unified database configuration tuning benchmark via surrogates that reduces the evaluation cost to a minimum, allowing for extensive runs and analysis of new techniques."

Our motivation comes from scientific database applications where a community of users is working together to assemble, revise, and curate a shared data repository. As the community accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time, it may contain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store. For example, Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database, whereas Bob disagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be in the database, and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead.   We propose a formal model for Belief Databases that interprets users' annotations as belief statements. These annotations can refer both to the base data and to other annotations. We give a formal semantics based on a fragment of multi-agent epistemic logic and define a query language over belief databases. We then prove a key technical result, stating that every belief database can be encoded as a canonical Kripke structure. We use this structure to describe a relational representation of belief databases, and give an algorithm for translating queries over the belief database into standard relational queries. Finally, we report early experimental results with our prototype implementation on synthetic data."

We provide a collection of tools for machine learning and other types of data analysis that guarantee differential privacy and accuracy as the underlying databases grow arbitrarily large. We give both a general technique and a specific algorithm for adaptive analysis of dynamically growing databases. Our general technique is illustrated by two algorithms that schedule black box access to some algorithm that operates on a fixed database to generically transform private and accurate algorithms for static databases into private and accurate algorithms for dynamically growing databases. These results show that almost any private and accurate algorithm can be rerun at appropriate points of data growth with minimal loss of accuracy, even when data growth is unbounded. Our specific algorithm directly adapts the private multiplicative weights algorithm to the dynamic setting, maintaining the accuracy guarantee of the static setting through unbounded data growth. Along the way, we develop extensions of several other differentially private algorithms to the dynamic setting, which may be of independent interest for future work on the design of differentially private algorithms for growing databases."

In very few projects, we will need to design a database system that fully adapt to our projects and have a high efficiency and concurrency. Therefore, it is very important to consider a feasible solution of designing a database system (We only consider the relational database system here). Meanwhile, for a database system, SQL interpretation and execution module is necessary. According to the theory of formal language and automata, the realization of this module can be completed by automata.

The using of strategy model and event driven design scheme is used and some improvement on general automata, for example a memory like structure is added to automata to make it better to store context.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce the index creation and update cost for in-memory databases.

However, conventional cracking algorithms are focused on simple column data structure rather than those complex index structure for in-memory databases. In order to show the feasibility of in-memory database index cracking and promote to future more extensive research, this paper conducted a case study on the Adaptive Radix Tree (ART), a popular tree index structure of in-memory databases.

Graph queries are used to query and modify graphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching that is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be employed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern matches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query performance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with the graphs stored in the graph database.   In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as technique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental maintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively and declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our maintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the graph database increases.

Proper business models are therefore essential for database operators to manage geo-location databases. Database access can be simultaneously priced under two different schemes: the registration scheme and the service plan scheme. In the registration scheme, the database reserves part of the TV bandwidth for registered White Space Devices (WSDs). In the service plan scheme, the WSDs are charged according to their queries. In this paper, we investigate the business model for the TVWS database under a hybrid pricing scheme. We consider the scenario where a database operator employs both the registration scheme and the service plan scheme to serve the SUs. The SUs' choices of different pricing schemes are modeled as a non-cooperative game and we derive distributed algorithms to achieve Nash Equilibrium (NE). Considering the NE of the SUs, the database operator optimally determines pricing parameters for both pricing schemes in terms of bandwidth reservation, registration fee and query plans."

            "summary": "Variability inherently exists in databases in various contexts which creates database variants. For example, variants of a database could have different schemas/content (database evolution problem), variants of a database could root from different sources (data integration problem), variants of a database could be deployed differently for specific application domain (deploying a database for different configurations of a software system), etc. Unfortunately, while there are specific solutions to each of the problems arising in these contexts, there is no general solution that accounts for variability in databases and addresses managing variability within a database. In this paper, we formally define variational databases (VDBs) and statically-typed variational relational algebra (VRA) to query VDBs---both database and queries explicitly account for variation. We also design and implement variational database management system (VDBMS) to run variational queries over a VDB effectively and efficiently. To assess this, we generate two VDBs from real-world databases in the context of software development and database evolution with a set of experimental queries for each."

            "summary": "In many real world networks, a vertex is usually associated with a transaction database that comprehensively describes the behaviour of the vertex. A typical example is the social network, where the behaviour of every user is depicted by a transaction database that stores his daily posted contents. A transaction database is a set of transactions, where a transaction is a set of items. Every path of the network is a sequence of vertices that induces multiple sequences of transactions. The sequences of transactions induced by all of the paths in the network forms an extremely large sequence database. Finding frequent sequential patterns from such sequence database discovers interesting subsequences that frequently appear in many paths of the network. However, it is a challenging task, since the sequence database induced by a database graph is too large to be explicitly induced and stored. In this paper, we propose the novel notion of database graph, which naturally models a wide spectrum of real world networks by associating each vertex with a transaction database. Our goal is to find the top-k frequent sequential patterns in the sequence database induced from a database graph. We prove that this problem is #P-hard. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient two-step sampling algorithm that approximates the top-k frequent sequential patterns with provable quality guarantee. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."

A database owner outsources an encrypted database to a cloud platform, needing only to store the secret keys for encryption and an empty table header for the database; the database users can make almost all types of queries on the encrypted database as usual; and the cloud can process ciphertext queries as if the database were not encrypted.

For example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments). In this case, mining the \"transposed\" database runs through a smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint, starting from those mined in the \"transposed\" database. Finally, we show how to generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones."

We consider simple probabilistic databases in which probabilities are associated with individual tuples, and general probabilistic databases in which, additionally, exclusivity relationships between tuples can be represented. In contrast to other recent research in this area, we do not limit ourselves to injective scoring functions. We formulate three intuitive postulates that the semantics of top-k queries in probabilistic databases should satisfy, and introduce a new semantics, Global-Topk, that satisfies those postulates to a large degree. We also show how to evaluate queries under the Global-Topk semantics. For simple databases we design dynamic-programming based algorithms, and for general databases we show polynomial-time reductions to the simple cases. For example, we demonstrate that for a fixed k the time complexity of top-k query evaluation is as low as linear, under the assumption that probabilistic databases are simple and scoring functions are injective."

Presented here is a method for performing automated denormalization of relational databases at run-time, without requiring access to source data or ongoing intervention by a database administrator.

This paper addresses issues that make this job more efficient and robust than existing approaches. It incorporates the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Schema specification in the database-XML relationship. Incorporation of the XML Schema exhibits significant improvements in XML content usage and reduces the limitations of DTD-based database XML services.

In this paper, we test this widely-held belief by directly looking for sentence reuse both within and between databases. Further, we investigate patterns of how sentences are reused over time. Finally, we consider the limitations of this form of analysis and the implications that this may have for bioinformatics database design.   We show that reuse of annotation is common within many different databases, and that also there is a detectable level of reuse between databases. In addition, we show that there are patterns of reuse that have previously been shown to be associated with percolation errors."

Conversely, emerging NewSQL and NoSQL data stores are designed to scale horizontally. NewSQL databases provide ACID transaction support; however, joins are limited to the partition keys, resulting in restricted query expressiveness. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are designed to scale out linearly on commodity hardware; however, they are limited by slow join performance. Hence, we consider if the NoSQL join performance can be improved while ensuring ACID semantics and without drastically sacrificing write performance, disk utilization and query expressiveness.   This paper presents the Synergy system that leverages schema and workload driven mechanism to identify materialized views and a specialized concurrency control system on top of a NoSQL database to enable scalable data management with familiar relational conventions. Synergy trades slight write performance degradation and increased disk utilization for faster join performance (compared to standard NoSQL databases) and improved query expressiveness (compared to NewSQL databases). Experimental results using the TPC-W benchmark show that, for a database populated with 1M customers, the Synergy system exhibits a maximum performance improvement of 80.5% as compared to other evaluated systems."

The equivalence of these properties has not been formally shown.   We generalize all of these definitions to alternating automata and show their equivalence. We further show that alternating GFG automata are as expressive as deterministic automata with the same acceptance conditions and indices. We then show that alternating GFG automata over finite words, and weak automata over infinite words, are not more succinct than deterministic automata, and that determinizing B\\\"uchi and co-B\\\"uchi alternating GFG automata involves a $2^{\\Theta(n)}$ state blow-up.

Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state numbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded. Finally, we present the characterization of all (regular) unary languages recognized by two-state affine automata."

We describe a polynomial minimization algorithm for GFG co-B\\\"uchi word automata with transition-based acceptance. Thus, a run is accepting if it traverses a set $\\alpha$ of designated transitions only finitely often. Our algorithm is based on a sequence of transformations we apply to the automaton, on top of which a minimal quotient automaton is defined. We use our minimization algorithm to show canonicity for transition-based GFG co-B\\\"uchi word automata: all minimal automata have isomorphic safe components (namely components obtained by restricting the transitions to these not in $\\alpha$) and once we saturate the automata with $\\alpha$-transitions, we get full isomorphism."

In this work, we introduce nested weighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it possible to express important quantitative properties such as average response time. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects results from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a finite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as the quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time verification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the basic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their applicability in several domains.

In this paper we continue the investigation of reaction automata with a focus on the formal language theoretic properties of subclasses of reaction automata, called linearbounded reaction automata (LRAs) and exponentially-bounded reaction automata (ERAs). Besides LRAs, we newly introduce an extended model (denoted by lambda-LRAs) by allowing lambda-moves in the accepting process of reaction, and investigate the closure properties of language classes accepted by both LRAs and lambda-LRAs. Further, we establish new relationships of language classes accepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results include the following : (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs forms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively enumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language accepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides with the class of context-sensitive languages."

Nested weighted automata extend weighted automata and consist of a master automaton and a set of slave automata that are invoked by the master automaton. Nested weighted automata are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time can be expressed with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher complexity (e.g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be active. We focus on automata whose master value function is the limit average. We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time with no overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k=1, but not with non-nested weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems (i.e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the complexity for weighted automata. Moreover, when k is part of the input given in unary we establish PSPACE-completeness."

This concerns namely techniques for size reduction and language inclusion testing, which are two problems that are crucial for many applications of tree automata. For size reduction of tree automata, we adapt the simulation quotient technique that is well established for finite word automata. We give efficient algorithms for computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of relation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward simulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination principle is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called antichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed originally for finite word automata for tree automata. Subsequently, we improve the antichain technique for both word and tree automata by combining it with the simulation-based inclusion checking techniques, significantly improving efficiency of the antichain method. We then show how the developed reduction and inclusion checking methods improve the method of abstract regular tree model checking, the method that was the original motivation for starting the work on tree automata. Both the reduction and the language inclusion methods are based on relatively simple and general principles that can be further extended for other types of automata and related formalisms. An example is our adaptation of the reduction methods for alternating B\\\"uchi automata, which results in an efficient alternating automata size reduction technique."

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in data-driven analysis of dynamical systems, with operator theoretic techniques being the most popular. Existing algorithms, like Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), use the entire data set for computation of the Koopman operator. However, many real life applications like power system analysis, biological systems, building systems etc. requires the real-time computation and updating of the Koopman operator, as new data streams in. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm for online computation of Koopman operator such that at each time step the Koopman operator is updated incrementally. In particular, we propose a Recursive Extended Dynamic Decomposition (rEDMD) algorithm for computation of Koopman operator from streaming data. Further, we test the algorithm in three different dynamical systems, namely, a linear system, a nonlinear system and a system governed by a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and illustrate the computational efficiency of the iterative algorithm over the existing DMD and EDMD algorithms."

In particular, we prove that the Kirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every operator system that is (min,er)-nuclear is also (el,c)-nuclear. We show that operator system quotients are not always equal to the corresponding operator space quotients and then study exactness of various operator system tensor products for the operator system quotient. We prove that an operator system is exact for the min tensor product if and only if it is (min,el)-nuclear. We give many characterizations of operator systems that are (min,er)-nulcear, (el,c)-nuclear, (min,el)-nulcear and (el,max)-nuclear.

Second, some topological characterizations to the covering lower approximation operator to be an interior operator are established. We find that the topologies induced by this operator and by the sixth type of covering lower approximation operator are the same. Third, we study the conditions which make the first type of covering upper approximation operator be a closure operator, and find that the topology induced by the operator is the same as the topology induced by the fifth type of covering upper approximation operator.

In the latter case, there are $n-1$ possible distinct operations per one n-level entangled pair. Similar results apply for generating interaction between a pair of remote systems and for remote measurements. We further consider remote operations on $N$ spatially distributed systems, and show that the number of possible distinct operations increases here exponentially, with the available number of entangled pairs that are initial distributed between the systems.

Third, it presents a laboratory teaching platform, whereby students build a minimal operating system for an embedded hardware platform. The proposed platform is called MiniOS.

Since the properties of operators from the first and second classes are well-known, we mainly study properties of the operators of the third class. We describe some Lyapunov functions of the operators and apply them to study $\\omega$-limit sets of the trajectories generated by the operators.

It is proved that to every such relational system there can be assigned a Sheffer groupoid and also, conversely, every Sheffer groupoid induces a directed relational system with involution. Hence, investigations of these relational systems can be transformed to the treaty of special groupoids which form a variety of algebras. If the Sheffer operation is also commutative then the induced binary relation is antisymmetric. Moreover, commutative Sheffer groupoids form a congruence distributive variety. We characterize symmertry, antisymmetry and treansitivity of binary relations by identities and quasi-identities satisfied by an assigned Sheffer operation. The concepts of twist-products of relational systems and of Kleene relational systems are introduced. We prove that every directed relational system can be embedded into a directed relational system with involution via the twist-product construction. If the relation in question is even transitive, then the directed relational system can be embedded into a Kleene relational system. Any Sheffer operation assigned to a directed relational system A with involution induces a Sheffer operation assigned to the twist-product of A."

Is it possible? Any system is created to enhance the value of output products of the system operation. Thus, two products: a consumer product that has value to the customer and the target product (value added), rewarding manufacturer of consumer value are formed at the output of the managed system. If the management system has degrees of freedom, obtaining a consumer product with desired quality characteristics can be achieved with various management modes, each corresponding to their costs, results and operation time. All that is necessary is to be able to evaluate the efficiency of the operation based on its basic indicators, available for any operation. Efficiency formula, which can be used to assess any target operation, including with distributed parameters was obtained. In this case, it is necessary to use numerical methods. As applied to the model of the simple operation, efficiency formula is extremely simple. To use it, it is necessary to get only three parameters from the system under study: the cost estimate of input products of the operation, the cost estimate of output products of the operation and the operation time. Since these basic indicators are available in absolutely any system, they can all be oriented to achieve the global goao - the maximum resource efficiency."

About the subelliptic properties of these operators, we established that quadratic operators with zero singular spaces fulfill global subelliptic estimates with a loss of derivatives depending on certain algebraic properties of the Hamilton maps associated to their Weyl symbols. The purpose of the present work is to prove similar global subelliptic estimates for overdetermined systems of quadratic operators.

In this paper, we present PIMOD, a software tool for configuring operating system images for single-board computer systems. We propose a simple yet comprehensive configuration language. In a configuration profile, called Pifile, a small set of commands is used to describe the configuration of an operating system image. Virtualization techniques are used during the execution of the profile in order to be distribution and platform independent. Commands can be issued in the guest operating system, providing access to the distribution specific tools, e.g., to configure hardware parameters.

To prove this, we also show that the identity map on any AW$^*$-factor is a pure completely positive linear map. For embeddings of operator systems into their C$^*$-envelopes, the issue of purity is seemingly harder to describe in full generality, and so we focus here on operator systems arising from the generators of discrete groups. The question of purity of the identity is quite subtle for operator system that are not C$^*$-algebras, and we have results only for two universal operator systems arising from discrete groups. Lastly, a previously unrecorded feature of pure completely positive linear maps is presented: every pure completely positive linear map on an operator system $\\mathcal R$ into an injective von Neumann algebra $\\mathcal M$ has a pure completely positive extension to any operator system $\\mathcal T$ that contains $\\mathcal R$ as an operator subsystem, thereby generalising a result of Arveson for the injective type I factor $\\mathcal B(\\mathcal H)$."

PI operators are a generalization of bounded linear operators on infinite-dimensional spaces that form a *-subalgebra with two binary operations (addition and composition) on the space RxL2. These operators frequently appear in analysis and control of infinite-dimensional systems such as Partial Differential equations (PDE) and Time-delay systems (TDS). Furthermore, PIETOOLS can: declare opvar decision variables, add operator positivity constraints, declare an objective function, and solve the resulting optimization problem using a syntax similar to the sdpvar class in YALMIP. Use of the resulting Linear Operator Inequalities (LOIs) are demonstrated on several examples, including stability analysis of a PDE, bounding operator norms, and verifying integral inequalities. The result is that PIETOOLS, packaged with SOSTOOLS and MULTIPOLY, offers a scalable, user-friendly and computationally efficient toolbox for parsing, performing algebraic operations, setting up and solving convex optimization problems on PI operators."

A tensor product operator on a pair of Hilbert spaces is a maximally general bilinear operator into a target Hilbert space. By 'maximally general' is meant every bilinear operator from the same pair of spaces to any Hilbert space factors into the composition of the tensor product operator with a uniquely determined linear mapping on the target space. There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type; there is no \"the\" tensor product. Distinctly different tensor product operators can be associated with different parts of a multipartite system without difficulty. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables is tensor product operator dependent. The same state in the target state space can be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable with respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished relative to the others; the unitary operator used to construct a Bell state from a pair of |0&gt;'s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime example. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type is given by composition with a unitary operator. There is an equivalence between change of tensor product operator and change of basis in the target space. Among the gains from change of tensor product operator is the localization of some nonlocal operators as well as separability of inseparable states. Examples are given."

Small errors accumulate in the simulation of each time step, resulting in completely different trajectories. However, the trajectories of many prominent chaotic systems live in a low-dimensional subspace (attractor). If the system is Markovian, the attractor is uniquely determined by the Markov operator that maps the evolution of infinitesimal time steps. This makes it possible to predict the behavior of the chaotic system by learning the Markov operator even if we cannot predict the exact trajectory. Recently, a new framework for learning resolution-invariant solution operators for PDEs was proposed, known as neural operators. In this work, we train a Markov neural operator (MNO) with only the local one-step evolution information. We then compose the learned operator to obtain the global attractor and invariant measure. Such a Markov neural operator forms a discrete semigroup and we empirically observe that does not collapse or blow up. Experiments show neural operators are more accurate and stable compared to previous methods on chaotic systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations."

The traditional role of an operating system controlling the execution of its own hardware is evolving toward a model whereby the controlling processor is distinct from the compute engines that are performing most of the computations. In this context, an operating system can be viewed as software that brokers and tracks the resources of the compute engines and is akin to a database management system. To explore the idea of using a database in an operating system role, this work defines key operating system functions in terms of rigorous mathematical semantics (associative array algebra) that are directly translatable into database operations. These operations possess a number of mathematical properties that are ideal for parallel operating systems by guaranteeing correctness over a wide range of parallel operations. The resulting operating system equations provide a mathematical specification for a Tabular Operating System Architecture (TabulaROSA) that can be implemented on any platform. Simulations of forking in TabularROSA are performed using an associative array implementation and compared to Linux on a 32,000+ core supercomputer. Using over 262,000 forkers managing over 68,000,000,000 processes, the simulations show that TabulaROSA has the potential to perform operating system functions on a massively parallel scale. The TabulaROSA simulations show 20x higher performance as compared to Linux while managing 2000x more processes in fully searchable tables."

Given a set of deep neural networks, each pre-trained for a single task, it is desired that executing arbitrary combinations of tasks yields minimal computation cost. Pruning each network separately yields suboptimal computation cost due to task relatedness. A promising remedy is to merge the networks into a multitask network to eliminate redundancy across tasks before network pruning. However, pruning a multitask network combined by existing network merging schemes cannot minimise the computation cost of every task combination because they do not consider such a future pruning. To this end, we theoretically identify the conditions such that pruning a multitask network minimises the computation of all task combinations. On this basis, we propose Pruning-Aware Merging (PAM), a heuristic network merging scheme to construct a multitask network that approximates these conditions. The merged network is then ready to be further pruned by existing network pruning methods. Evaluations with different pruning schemes, datasets, and network architectures show that PAM achieves up to 4.87x less computation against the baseline without network merging, and up to 2.01x less computation against the baseline with a state-of-the-art network merging scheme."

We propose a new, declarative abstraction called AppSlice that jointly considers the application's compute and network requirements. This abstraction leverages container management systems to manage edge computing resources, and 5G network stacks to manage network resources, while the joint consideration of coupling between compute and network usage is explicitly managed by a new runtime system, which delivers the declarative semantics of the app slice. The runtime system also jointly manages the edge compute and network resource usage automatically across different edge computing environments and 5G networks by using two adaptive algorithms. We implement a complex, real-world, real-time monitoring application using the proposed app slice abstraction, and demonstrate on a private 5G/LTE testbed that the proposed runtime system significantly improves the application performance and resource usage when compared with the case where the coupling between the compute and network resource usage is ignored."

            "summary": "Computer networks covered the entire world and a serious and new development has not formed for many years. But companies and consumer organizations complain about the failure to add new features to their networks and according to their need, like much of the works to be done automatically and they also like to develop and expand their networks on the software side so they do not need new expensive hardware for many of the activities and needs of their network. Analysis of the control layers and writing data in Software-Defined Network facilitate network management and accelerate innovation in network. In order to develop broad networks of SDN, often a large number controller is needed and located position of controllers in the SDN networks and can be raised as an important and basic issue in the field of SDN network and have impact on reliability of SDN networks. This paper focused on latency and reliability in SDN networks. The latency here means the delay in response to the request of data path that has a significant impact on network latency. In this paper it is shown that the number of controllers and their position can be effective on two measures; reliability and latency in SDN networks."

A model of such networks in computer data transmission is discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their basic stability property."

The computing resource allocation solution needs to be carefully designed to guarantee the computing resource efficiency of MEC networks. Based on the potential game theory, a computing resource allocation solution is proposed to reduce energy consumption and improve computing resource efficiency in MEC networks. The computing resource allocation solution includes two parts: the first part is the power control scheme based on the potential game theory and the second part is the computing resource allocation scheme based on linear programming. The power control scheme is to find a set of the transmission powers of base stations (BSs) that maximizes the potential function of MEC networks. The computing resource allocation scheme is to maximize the average computing resource allocation coefficient of the MEC networks based on the results of the power control scheme. Compared with traditional solutions, simulation results indicate the computing resource utilization and energy efficiency of the proposed computing resource allocation solution are significantly improved."

Such systems are called multimodal, and examples include logistic networks, biomedical phenomena, manufacturing process and telecommunication networks. Existing techniques for determining optimal paths in multimodal networks have either required heuristics or else application-specific constraints to obtain tractable problems, removing the multimodal traits of the network during analysis. In this paper weighted coloured--edge graphs are introduced to model multimodal networks, where colours represent the modes of transportation. Optimal paths are selected using a partial order that compares the weights in each colour, resulting in a Pareto optimal set of shortest paths. This approach is shown to be tractable through experimental analyses for random and real multimodal networks without the need to apply heuristics or constraints."

This network is a small-world network with an elite-clique at its center in which elites are also the centers of many small groups. These leaders also act as bridges between different small groups. Network dynamics are an important research topic due to their ability to explain the evolution of network structures. In this paper, a Chinese Venture Capital (VC) network was coded from joint investments between VC firms and then analyzed to uncover its network properties and factors that influence its evolution. We first built a random graph model to control for factors such as network scale, network growth, investment frequency and syndication tendency. Then we added a partner-selection mechanism and used two theories to analyze the formation of network structure: relational embeddedness and structural embeddedness. After that, we ran simulations and compared the three models with the actual Chinese VC network. To do this we computed the elite-clique's EI index, degree distribution, clustering coefficient distribution and motifs. Results show that adding embeddedness theories significantly improved the network dynamic model's predictive power, and help us uncover the mechanisms that affect the formation of a small-world industrial network with an elite-clique at its center."

Several methods have been proposed to compress the size of the networks without reducing network performance. Network pruning can reduce redundant and unnecessary parameters from a network. Knowledge distillation can transfer the knowledge of deeper and wider networks to smaller networks. The performance of the smaller network obtained by these methods is bounded by the predefined network. Neural architecture search has been proposed, which can search automatically the architecture of the networks to break the structure limitation. Also, there is a dynamic configuration method to train networks incrementally as sub-networks. In this paper, we present a novel incremental training algorithm for deep neural networks called planting. Our planting can search the optimal network architecture with smaller number of parameters for improving the network performance by augmenting channels incrementally to layers of the initial networks while keeping the earlier trained parameters fixed. Also, we propose using the knowledge distillation method for training the channels planted. By transferring the knowledge of deeper and wider networks, we can grow the networks effectively and efficiently. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on different datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and STL-10. For the STL-10 dataset, we show that we are able to achieve comparable performance with only 7% parameters compared to the larger network and reduce the overfitting caused by a small amount of the data."

Moreover, by analyzing the different functionalities of computation resources in SDN, C-RAN, and MCC, we can show diverse and flexible form that the computation resources present in different networks. The study of computation diversity can provide guidance to the future networks design, i.e., how to allocate the resources jointly between computation (e.g., CPU capacity) and communication (e.g., bandwidth), and thereby saving system energy and increase users' experiences."

Many characteristics of the well-studied multiple unicast network communication problem also hold for sum-networks due to a known reduction between instances of these two problems. In this work, we describe an algorithm to construct families of sum-network instances using incidence structures. The computation capacity of several of these sum-network families is characterized. We demonstrate that unlike the multiple unicast problem, the computation capacity of sum-networks depends on the characteristic of the finite field over which the sum is computed. This dependence is very strong; we show examples of sum-networks that have a rate-1 solution over one characteristic but a rate close to zero over a different characteristic. Additionally, a sum-network can have an arbitrary different number of computation capacities for different alphabets. This is contrast to the multiple unicast problem where it is known that the capacity is independent of the network coding alphabet."

Connections between network coding problems and matroids have been well studied. In this work, we establish a relation between network computation problems and representable matroids. We show that a network computation problem in which the sinks demand linear functions of source messages admits a scalar linear solution if and only if it is matroidal with respect to a representable matroid whose representation fulfills certain constraints dictated by the network computation problem. Next, we obtain a connection between network computation problems and functional dependency relations (FD-relations) and show that FD-relations can be used to characterize network computation problem with arbitrary (not necessarily linear) function demands as well as nonlinear network codes."

After morphing a parent network, the child network is expected to inherit the knowledge from its parent network and also has the potential to continue growing into a more powerful one with much shortened training time. The first requirement for this network morphism is its ability to handle diverse morphing types of networks, including changes of depth, width, kernel size, and even subnet. To meet this requirement, we first introduce the network morphism equations, and then develop novel morphing algorithms for all these morphing types for both classic and convolutional neural networks. The second requirement for this network morphism is its ability to deal with non-linearity in a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to facilitate the morphing of any continuous non-linear activation neurons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network morphism scheme."

We use five different social network datasets which are contextually and semantically different from each other. We then analyze these networks using a number of different network statistics and metrics.

In this paper, we investigate Virtual Network Embedding strategies and related issues for resource allocation of an Internet Provider(InP) to efficiently embed virtual networks that are requested by Virtual Network Operators(VNOs) who share the same infrastructure provided by the InP. In order to achieve that goal, we design a heuristic Virtual Network Embedding algorithm that simultaneously embeds virtual nodes and virtual links of each virtual network request onto physic infrastructure. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme improves significantly the performance of Virtual Network Embedding by enhancing the long-term average revenue as well as acceptance ratio and resource utilization of virtual network requests compared to prior algorithms."

As wireless networks become more complex, it is impractical to perform testing on a real deployment. As a result, the network administrators rely on network simulators or network emulators to validate their configurations and design. Unfortunately, network simulation falls short per it requires users to model the network behavior analytically. On the other hand, network emulation allows users to employ real network applications on virtualized network devices. Despite their complex design, the existing network emulation solutions miss full-scale automation rather they rely on experienced users to write complex configuration scripts making testing. Therefore, the validation process is prone to human operator errors. Furthermore, they require a significant amount of computational resources that might not be feasible for many users. Moreover, most network emulators focus on lower layers of the network thus requiring users to employ their own network applications to control and measure network performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel wireless network emulation platform, the system, that provides users a unified, high-level configuration interface for different layers of wireless networks to reduce management complexities of network emulators while having a generic, fully-automated platform. Menes is a generic, full-stack, fully-automated test and validation platform that empowers existing state-of-the-art emulation, virtualization, and network applications including performance measurement tools. We then provide an implementation of Menes based on the EMANE with Docker.

This paper is intended to refine the design, analysis, and documentation of network architecture by adopting a conceptual model called a thinging (abstract) machine (TM), which views all components of a network in terms of a single notion: the flow of things in a TM. Since cloud computing has become increasingly popular in the last few years as a model for a shared pool of networks, servers, storage, and applications, we apply the TM to model a real case study of cloud networks. The resultant model introduces an integrated representation of computer networks."

            "summary": "The following \\textit{network computing} problem is considered. Source nodes in a directed acyclic network generate independent messages and a single receiver node computes a target function $f$ of the messages. The objective is to maximize the average number of times $f$ can be computed per network usage, i.e., the ``computing capacity''. The \\textit{network coding} problem for a single-receiver network is a special case of the network computing problem in which all of the source messages must be reproduced at the receiver. For network coding with a single receiver, routing is known to achieve the capacity by achieving the network \\textit{min-cut} upper bound. We extend the definition of min-cut to the network computing problem and show that the min-cut is still an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate and is tight for computing (using coding) any target function in multi-edge tree networks and for computing linear target functions in any network. We also study the bound's tightness for different classes of target functions. In particular, we give a lower bound on the computing capacity in terms of the Steiner tree packing number and a different bound for symmetric functions. We also show that for certain networks and target functions, the computing capacity can be less than an arbitrarily small fraction of the min-cut bound."

The flow throughput values are clustered in two stages, outlier values are determined within each cluster, and the flow outliers are used to compute the outlier factor or score for each network link.

In this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates networking, caching and computing in a systematic way and enables dynamic orchestration of these three resources to improve the end-to-end system performance and meet the requirements of different applications. Then, we consider the bandwidth, caching and computing resource allocation issue and formulate it as a joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem to minimize the combination cost of network usage and energy consumption in the framework. To minimize the combination cost of network usage and energy consumption in the framework, we formulate it as a joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem. In addition, we solve the joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem using an exhaustive-search algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the traditional network without in-network caching/computing in terms of network usage and energy consumption."

Multiple transmitters send independent messages to multiple receivers which decode the same set of messages. In this work, computation over multicast networks is considered: each receiver decodes an identical function of the original messages. For a countably infinite class of two-transmitter two-receiver single-hop linear deterministic networks, the computing capacity is characterized for a linear function (modulo-2 sum) of Bernoulli sources. Inspired by the geometric concept of interference alignment in networks, a new achievable coding scheme called function alignment is introduced. A new converse theorem is established that is tighter than cut-set based and genie-aided bounds. Computation (vs. communication) over multicast networks requires additional analysis to account for multiple receivers sharing a network's computational resources. We also develop a network decomposition theorem which identifies elementary parallel subnetworks that can constitute an original network without loss of optimality. The decomposition theorem provides a conceptually-simpler algebraic proof of achievability that generalizes to $L$-transmitter $L$-receiver networks."

In such a network, a sink node desires to compute with zero error a {\\em target function}, of which the inputs are generated at multiple source nodes. The edges in the network are assumed to be error-free and have limited capacity. The nodes in the network are assumed to have unbounded computing capability and be able to perform network coding. The {\\em computing rate} of a network code that can compute the target function over the network is the average number of times that the target function is computed with zero error for one use of the network. In this paper, we obtain an improved upper bound on the computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary target functions and arbitrary network topologies. This improved upper bound not only is an enhancement of the previous upper bounds but also is the first tight upper bound on the computing capacity for computing an arithmetic sum over a certain non-tree network, which has been widely studied in the literature. We also introduce a multi-dimensional array approach that facilitates evaluation of the improved upper bound. Furthermore, we apply this bound to the problem of computing a vector-linear function over a network. With this bound, we are able to not only enhance a previous result on computing a vector-linear function over a network but also simplify the proof significantly. Finally, we prove that for computing the binary maximum function over the reverse butterfly network, our improved upper bound is not achievable. This result establishes that in general our improved upper bound is non achievable, but whether it is asymptotically achievable or not remains open."

            "summary": "Next-generation wireless networks will provide users ubiquitous low-latency computing services using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC, mobile computation offloading (MCO), is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since each edge device comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), a MEC network can be decomposed as a radio access network (RAN) cascaded with a CS network (CSN). Based on the architecture, we investigate network constrained latency performance, namely communication latency (comm-latency) and computation latency (comp-latency) under the constraints of RAN coverage and CSN stability. To this end, a spatial random network is modeled featuring random node distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal multiple access, and random computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network constraints, we derive the scaling laws of comm-latency and comp-latency with respect to network-load parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates) and network-resource parameters (bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, CS computation rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the interplay of theories of stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the derived scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network coverage and network stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network provisioning and planning by avoiding either of the cascaded RAN or CSN being a performance bottleneck."

The edge directionality in the directed network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected network. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that maps a semantic network to an undirected network. Thus, aside from space constraints, the semantic network construct does not have any modeling functionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network representation. Two proofs of this idea will be presented. The first is a proof of the aforementioned function composition concept. The second is a simpler proof involving an undirected binary encoding of a semantic network."

State-of-the-art switches with near line rate computing and aggregation capabilities are developed to enable, e.g., acceleration and better utilization for modern applications like big data analytics, and large-scale distributed and federated machine learning. We formulate and study the problem of activating a limited number of in-network computing devices within a network, aiming at reducing the overall network utilization for a given workload. Such limitations on the number of in-network computing elements per workload arise, e.g., in incremental upgrades of network infrastructure, and are also due to requiring specialized middleboxes, or FPGAs, that should support heterogeneous workloads, and multiple tenants.   We present an optimal and efficient algorithm for placing such devices in tree networks with arbitrary link rates, and further evaluate our proposed solution in various scenarios and for various tasks. Our results show that having merely a small fraction of network devices support in-network aggregation can lead to a significant reduction in network utilization. Furthermore, we show that various intuitive strategies for performing such placements exhibit significantly inferior performance compared to our solution, for varying workloads, tasks, and link rates."

However, there actually exist two disadvantages with GRM in practice. One is that GRM has large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which restrict the applications of CS. Another is that the CS measurements randomly obtained by GRM cannot provide sufficient reconstruction performances. In this paper, a Deep neural network based Sparse Measurement Matrix (DSMM) is learned by the proposed convolutional network to reduce the sampling computational complexity and improve the CS reconstruction performance. Two sub networks are included in the proposed network, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, the sparsity and the normalization are both considered by the limitation of the storage and the computational complexity. In order to improve the CS reconstruction performance, a reconstruction sub-network are introduced to help enhance the sampling sub-network. So by the offline iterative training of the proposed end-to-end network, the DSMM is generated for accurate measurement and excellent reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DSMM outperforms GRM greatly on representative CS reconstruction methods"

We test this method on recurrent neural networks applied to simple sequence prediction problems. Starting with initial networks containing only one node, the method automatically builds networks that successfully solve the tasks. The number of nodes in the final network correlates with task difficulty. The method can dynamically increase network size in response to an abrupt complexification in the task; however, reduction in network size in response to task simplification is not evident for reasonable meta-parameters. The method does not penalize network performance for these test tasks: variable-size networks actually reach better performance than fixed-size networks of higher, lower or identical size. We conclude by discussing how this method could be applied to more complex networks, such as feedforward layered networks, or multiple-area networks of arbitrary shape."

We model and simulate random resistive switch networks and analyze their computational capacities. We provide a detailed discussion of the relevant design parameters and establish the link to the physical assemblies by relating the modeling parameters to physical parameters. More globally connected networks and an increased network switching activity are means to increase the computational capacity linearly at the expense of exponentially growing energy consumption. We discuss a new modular approach that exhibits higher computational capacities and energy consumption growing linearly with the number of networks used.

Orchard networks are a recently introduced generalization of the class of tree-child networks. Structural characterizations have already been discovered for tree-based networks; this is not the case for orchard networks. In this paper, we introduce cherry covers---a unifying characterization of both network classes---in which we decompose the edges of the networks into so-called cherry shapes and reticulated cherry shapes.

The applications include chemical and metabolic systems, food webs as well as social networks. Lately, it was found that many of these networks display some common topological features, such as high clustering, small average path length (small world networks) and a power-law degree distribution (scale free networks). The topological features of a network are commonly related to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not account for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength. Here we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of nodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the functionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong correlations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world functionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the network, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From this information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to extract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined as the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the network. Using this method we distinguish between a topological small world and a functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long range correlations and high connectivity. Clearly, networks which share the same topology, may have different connectivities, based on the nature and strength of their interactions. The method is demonstrated on metabolic networks, but can be readily generalized to other types of networks."

However, we argue in this paper that CEP is a good candidate for in-network computing along the communication path avoiding detouring streams to distant servers to minimize communication latency while also exploiting processing capabilities of novel networking hardware. We show that it is feasible to express CEP operations in P4 and also present a tool to compile CEP operations, formulated in our P4CEP rule specification language, to P4 code.

We identify readily computable network invariants and establish their quantitative stability under this network distance. We also discuss the computational complexity involved in precisely computing this distance, and develop easily-computable lower bounds by using the identified invariants.

            "summary": "While spike timing has been shown to carry detailed stimulus information at the sensory periphery, its possible role in network computation is less clear. Most models of computation by neural networks are based on population firing rates. In equivalent spiking implementations, firing is assumed to be random such that averaging across populations of neurons recovers the rate-based approach. Recently, however, Den\\'eve and colleagues have suggested that the spiking behavior of neurons may be fundamental to how neuronal networks compute, with precise spike timing determined by each neuron's contribution to producing the desired output. By postulating that each neuron fires in order to reduce the error in the network's output, it was demonstrated that linear computations can be carried out by networks of integrate-and-fire neurons that communicate through instantaneous synapses. This left open, however, the possibility that realistic networks, with conductance-based neurons with subthreshold nonlinearity and the slower timescales of biophysical synapses, may not fit into this framework. Here, we show how the spike-based approach can be extended to biophysically plausible networks. We then show that our network reproduces a number of key features of cortical networks including irregular and Poisson-like spike times and a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. Lastly, we discuss how the behavior of our model scales with network size, or with the number of neurons \"recorded\" from a larger computing network. These results significantly increase the biological plausibility of the spike-based approach to network computation."

            "summary": "Networks (or graphs) are used to model the dyadic relations between entities in a complex system. In cases where there exists multiple relations between the entities, the complex system can be represented as a multilayer network, where the network in each layer represents one particular relation (or feature). The analysis of multilayer networks involves combining edges from specific layers and then computing a network property.   Different subsets of the layers can be combined. For any Boolean combination operation (e.g. AND, OR), the number of possible subsets is exponential to the number of layers. Thus recomputing for each subset from scratch is an expensive process. In this paper, we propose to efficiently analyze multilayer networks using a method that we term network decomposition.   Network decomposition is based on analyzing each network layer individually and then aggregating the analysis results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using network decomposition for detecting communities on different combinations of network layers. Our results on multilayer networks obtained from real-world and synthetic datasets show that our proposed network decomposition method requires significantly lower computation time while producing results of high accuracy."

We propose in this paper a spatial neural network model to analyze the important class of functional networks, which are commonly employed in computational studies of clinical brain imaging time series. We developed a simulation framework inspired by multichannel brain surface recordings (more specifically, EEG -- electroencephalogram) in order to link the mesoscopic network dynamics (represented by sampled functional networks) and the microscopic network structure (represented by an integrate-and-fire neural network located in a 3D space -- hence the term spatial neural network). Functional networks are obtained by computing pairwise correlations between time-series of mesoscopic electric potential dynamics, which allows the construction of a graph where each node represents one time-series. The spatial neural network model is central in this study in the sense that it allowed us to characterize sampled functional networks in terms of what features they are able to reproduce from the underlying spatial network. Our modeling approach shows that, in specific conditions of sample size and edge density, it is possible to precisely estimate several network measurements of spatial networks by just observing functional samples."

The specific service examined in this paper is network self-prediction enabled by Active Virtual Network Management Prediction. Computation/communication is analyzed via Kolmogorov Complexity. The result is a mechanism to understand and improve the performance of active networking and Active Virtual Network Management Prediction in particular. The Active Virtual Network Management Prediction mechanism allows information, in various states of algorithmic and static form, to be transported in the service of prediction for network management. The results are generally applicable to algorithmic transmission of information. Kolmogorov Complexity is used and experimentally validated as a theory describing the relationship among algorithmic compression, complexity, and prediction accuracy within an active network. Finally, the paper concludes with a complexity-based framework for Information Assurance that attempts to take a holistic view of vulnerability analysis."

SDN separates the data packet forwarding plane, i.e., the data plane, from the control plane and employs a central controller. Network virtualization allows the flexible sharing of physical networking resources by multiple users (tenants). Each tenant runs its own applications over its virtual network, i.e., its slice of the actual physical network. The virtualization of SDN networks promises to allow networks to leverage the combined benefits of SDN networking and network virtualization and has therefore attracted significant research attention in recent years. A critical component for virtualizing SDN networks is an SDN hypervisor that abstracts the underlying physical SDN network into multiple logically isolated virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), each with its own controller. We comprehensively survey hypervisors for SDN networks in this article. We categorize the SDN hypervisors according to their architecture into centralized and distributed hypervisors. We furthermore sub-classify the hypervisors according to their execution platform into hypervisors running exclusively on general-purpose compute platforms, or on a combination of general-purpose compute platforms with general- or special-purpose network elements. We exhaustively compare the network attribute abstraction and isolation features of the existing SDN hypervisors. As part of the future research agenda, we outline the development of a performance evaluation framework for SDN hypervisors."

The structure of the function is described by a given computation schema, which in turn is represented by a directed tree. We design computing and communicating schemes to obtain the function at the terminal at the maximum rate. For this, we formulate linear programs to determine network flows that maximize the computation rate. We then develop fast combinatorial primal-dual algorithm to obtain $\\epsilon$-approximate solutions to these linear programs. We then briefly describe extensions of our techniques to the cases of multiple terminals wanting different functions, multiple computation schemas for a function, computation with a given desired precision, and to networks with energy constraints at nodes."

Visualisation is widely used to present information about the dynamics of network traffic dynamics. Although it provides operators with an overall view and specific information about particular traffic or attacks on the network, it often fails to represent the events in an understandable way. Visualisations require visual attention and so are not well suited to continuous monitoring scenarios in which network administrators must carry out other tasks. Situational awareness is critical and essential for decision-making in the domain of computer network monitoring where it is vital to be able to identify and recognize network environment behaviours.Here we present SoNSTAR (Sonification of Networks for SiTuational AwaReness), a real-time sonification system to be used in the monitoring of computer networks to support the situational awareness of network administrators. SoNSTAR provides an auditory representation of all the TCP/IP protocol traffic within a network based on the different traffic flows between between network hosts. SoNSTAR raises situational awareness levels for computer network defence by allowing operators to achieve better understanding and performance while imposing less workload compared to visual techniques. SoNSTAR identifies the features of network traffic flows by inspecting the status flags of TCP/IP packet headers and mapping traffic events to recorded sounds to generate a soundscape representing the real-time status of the network traffic environment. Listening to the soundscape allows the administrator to recognise anomalous behaviour quickly and without having to continuously watch a computer screen."

In this paper, we identify some key distinctions between the functions computed by neural networks and those by marginal Bayesian network queries, showing that the former are more expressive than the latter. Moreover, we propose a simple augmentation to Bayesian networks (a testing operator), which enables their marginal queries to become \"universal approximators.\""

However, designing a scalable numeric static analysis for real-world Java programs presents a multitude of design choices, each of which may interact with others.

Moreover, this choice could interact with how we choose to represent aliasing in the heap and/or whether we use a relational numeric domain, e.g., convex polyhedra. In this paper, we present a family of abstract interpretation-based numeric static analyses for Java and systematically evaluate the impact of 162 analysis configurations on the DaCapo benchmark suite. Our experiment considered the precision and performance of the analyses for discharging array bounds checks. We found that top-down analysis is generally a better choice than bottom-up analysis, and that using access paths to describe heap objects is better than using summary objects corresponding to points-to analysis locations. Moreover, these two choices are the most significant, while choices about the numeric domain, representation of abstract objects, and context-sensitivity make much less difference to the precision/performance tradeoff."

To better understand the underlying mechanism of the inchworm Monte Carlo method, we distinguish two types of exponential error growth, which are known as the numerical sign problem and the error amplification. The former is due to the fast growth of variance in the stochastic method, which can be observed from the Dyson series, and the latter comes from the evolution of the numerical solution. Our analysis demonstrates that the technique of partial resummation can be considered as a tool to balance these two types of error, and the inchwormMonte Carlo method is a successful case where the numerical sign problem is effectively suppressed by such means.

This analysis is particularly useful for analyzing numerical schemes used in simulation of traveling linear waves such as in computational electromagnetics (CEM) and computational aeroacoustics(CAA)."

The theoretical part uses ideas from optimal transport and for the numerical solution we study and implement a damped Newton algorithm to solve the semi discrete problem. A detailed analysis is carried out to solve the near field one source refraction problem and extensions to the far field are also mentioned."

A method based on an explicit nonlocal finite-difference scheme (ENFDS) and the Adams-Bashfort-Moulton (ABM) method is considered a numerical analysis tool. An analysis of the errors of the methods is carried out, and it is shown that the ABM method is more accurate and converges faster to an exact solution than the ENFDS method."
